    <h2>Dynamic rotating 2d vectors around an origin</h2>
    <p>This app was my first graphical application. I had built UI with a number of different libraries and frameworks, but I had never built anything purely graphical purely with a graphical api.</p>
    <p>My intent was to learn more about vectors and practice abit of trigonometry in my programming.</p>
    <p>The vectors rotate at a random speed that errs towards a higher speed the longer the vector. This allowed me to see that I can calculate the length of a vector, and that the angle indeed controls the rate of rotation around the origin.</p>
    <p>Use the buttons to pause rotation.</p>
