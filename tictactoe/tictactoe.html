        <h2>A basic tic tac toe game. Winner declared in the console</h2>
        <p>This is my first interactive graphics application. The pausing functionality in the previous vector rotation app was implemented using HTML. This application uses raw mouse input to determine the location, and uses the canvas aphics api exclusively to draw everything you see in the game.</p>
        <p>mousemove event is used as the main game event loop.</p>
