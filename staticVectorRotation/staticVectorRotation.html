        <h2>I mostly pure version of the dynamic vector app</h2>
        <p>This app was an attempt to use a mostly pure functional approach to writing the dynamic rotation app. The experiment was intended to make use of a home grown functional math and array library (which i named stdlib out of habit) to learn more about pure functions. All of the state of the application is located in appstart, and all impurities are encapsulated in the draw.js file</p>
        <p>This experiment was interesting in that it naturally produced the style in which the app is written. For more information, see the README.md</p>
